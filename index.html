# Welcome to the FIX Trading Community GitHub Site
This site is supported by the [FIX Trading Community] (http://www.fixtradingcommunity.org). The purpose for this site is the development of open technical standards and supporting open source reference implementations of these technical standards. Our belief is that quality technical standards are best developed in an environment where competent people can contribute if they are so motivated unimpeded.
