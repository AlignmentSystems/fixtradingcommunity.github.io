	<p>
		This site is supported by the <a
			href="http://www.fixtradingcommunity.org">FIX Trading Community</a>.
		The purpose for this site is the development of open technical
		standards and supporting open source reference implementations of
		these technical standards. Our belief is that quality technical
		standards are best developed in an environment where competent people
		can contribute if they are so motivated in as unimpeded way as
		possible, while protecting an orderly standards development process.

	<h2>Simple Binary Encoding specification</h2>
	<h3>A FIX standard for binary message encoding</h3>
	<p>FIX Simple Binary Encoding (SBE) targets high performance
		trading systems, but may be suitable for other high performance
		applications as well. It is optimized for low latency of encoding and
		decoding while keeping bandwidth utilization reasonably small. This
		encoding specification describes the wire protocol for messages
		(presentation layer). Thus, it provides a standard for
		interoperability between communicating parties. Users are free to
		implement the standard in a way that best suits their needs. The
		encoding standard is complimentary to other FIX standards for session
		protocol and application level behavior. SBE is intended to represent
		all FIX semantics.</p>

	<h2>FIXP - the FIX Performance Session Layer specification</h2>
	<h3>A FIX standard for high performance message exchange</h3>
	<p>FIX Performance Session Layer (FIXP) is a lightweight protocol
		designed to replace the traditional FIX session protocol (known
		officially as FIXT) for high performance use cases. It supports both
		point-to-point exchange of application messages as well as multicasts
		for market data and the like.</p>

	<h2>silverflash - reference implementation for FIXP</h2>
	<h3>A FIX engine for high performance protocols</h3>
	<p>This project is a reference implementation of FIXP Performance
		Session Layer. It is intended to aid developers of financial and other
		critical applications. Since the protocol stack is standardized, it
		serves to exchange messages between organizations while keeping low
		latency characteristics.</p>
